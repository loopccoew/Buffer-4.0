Here we are with TECHEASE, which is an open innovation application for senior citizens.
Living in this technosavvy world, its difficult for elderly people to cope up with this evolving technology. Current interaction designs often feature illegible text, tiny targets, startling sounds, and other features that make the online world unfriendly to older users.so here is our genuine try to deal with this situation.
So TECHEASE is a user friendly java application with a strong base of various data structures such as arraylist,queue,hashmap and doubly circular linkedlist and with an appealing GUI using Java swing.

<h2 align="center" id="title">Brief Explanation</h2>
<p>1.Here we have displayed the time and date as seen on our mobile phones using libraries such as Date-time format and calender.

2.At the right corner, we see a buzzer which can be pressed in emergency situations.
It sends a mail to all the family members so that they get notified about the emergency.
The data structure which we used here is Queue.E-mail addresses of family members are stored in a queue.On pressing the buzzer emails are sent until the queue gets empty. 

3.Whatsup
This is a Client-Server  chatting application based on Socket Programming.Using this users can connect with their loved ones. Here networking concepts are used where messages are port from server to client.The libraries used are :
ServerSocket , DataInput/outStream and many more.

4.Contact : 
It is a basic phonebook application created using HashMap.The key-value pair in the HashMap are Name and phonenum respectively ,keeping the time complexity of search operation constant.The entries are stored in a csv file which acts as a database.

5.Radio :
Which is a music applet for entertainment purpose.We've created generic doubly circular linked list with are own methods.Each song is stored in a node. We can play, pause and move to next or previous song.At the end of the play list it loops back to the first song due to the circular nature of the linked list.

6.Alarm :
Taking medicines on time is a neccessity.So to set a remainder we've built an alarm clock where we can set time and medicine name.Internally the entries are stored in array list.

CONCLUSION : 

So this was our TECHEASE application.
Overall, this project has provided valuable insights into creating a techno-friendly world.
It has also highlighted the challenges faced by elderly people , and offers potential solutions to address these issues.

Hope we have made technology a bit easier for our silver generation.
