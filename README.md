/Project:- HEALTHCARE



Objective of Project:-
Healthcare resource allocation - Create a healthcare resource allocation system that uses data structures such as queues and stacks to manage patient waitlists and prioritize critical cases.


Features of our project:-
Our project manages the waiting list of the patient based on their status (critical/normal). If the patient is Critical they will be treated first.
We have added the provision in normal list to that is the patient who is added first  to the list will be given more priority then the next patient


Data Structures used:-
We used the Data structures stack and List to manage the waiting list.
When a new patient is added in the waiting list he will be added in Stack or list based on this Status(Critical/Normal).
If the patient is Critical then he will be added to the stack
If the patient is Normal they will be added to the ArrayList.
Now based on the number of beds available and their Status they will be treated.
All the Patients in the stack will be treated before the patients in the list
