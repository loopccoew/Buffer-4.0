# Buffer-4.0
Buffer is a Data Structures and Algorithms Project series, in which students can participate as mentees in teams of 3-4 people. 
This year the themes on which students can create a project are-

1. Healthcare
2. Digital Society
3. Open Innovation
4. Custom data structure to store data

This repository is created for all the teams to be able to upload their final project source code for the same. 

While submitting, note that: 

Each folder should have the name of the team and inside a readme file with team member details, (name, year, branch) and their theme. The readme file should also contain the link to their presentation as well as the drive link where both the report documents would be stored. 

Happy Coding :)
