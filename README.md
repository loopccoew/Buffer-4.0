# PrioDoc - A Priority Queue Based Patient Management System

This is a web-based application that allows doctors to manage their patient queue. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and uses Firebase for real-time data synchronization and storage. The data structure used for the Priority Queue is arrays and the language used is JavaScript. The application allows doctors to view their current patient, next patient (if any), and completed patients, as well as to mark a patient as completed and remove them from the queue. The application is designed to improve the efficiency of patient management for doctors and ultimately improve patient care.
