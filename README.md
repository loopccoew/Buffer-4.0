PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Building a console-based programme to make donations anywhere anytime in a click.

FEATURES:
This is a console-based programme which simulates Disaster Campaign Funding.
It enables the admin to securely login into the admin’s window to add and edit campaign details.
It allows users to create their accounts on the platform to make donations to various campaigns.
Users can choose how much to donate and which campaign to donate to.
Appropriate output is generated according to the user’s and admin's input.

DATA STRUCTURES USED:
1. SINGLY LINKED LIST:
  List of all users
  List of donations they make.
  List of user's details.
Size of these lists is dynamic, hence singly linked list is used for efficient insertion and deletion.

2. ARRAY OF OBJECTS : 
  To store the requirements of the each campaign.
Array of object allows us to deal with number of attributes connected with a single entity.

3. ARRAY: 
  Used to implement array of objects.
  
LEARNINGS AND OUTCOMES:
Importance and application of Abstract Data Types (ADTs) and Flowcharts
Application and implementation of various linear data structures
Importance of static keyword (used a static variable to keep track object we are refering to)
Learned a powerful tool - GitHub

WHAT'S NEXT:
User interface for better user experience.
Database for storing user history and donation data.
