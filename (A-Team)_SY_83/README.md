Objective:
This code aims to make calculations and storing of the data for the person of authority in societies (Treasurer, Chairman, Secretary). Thus here the user will be one of the authority members who will manage the finances of the society.

Scope:
Calculations of any society depend on the Inward Payment(Maintenance) and Outward Payment(Expenses). Thus knowing the balances of both the payments become really necessary for the financial management of the society. This code will help the Treasurer to maintain a record of maintenance for each flat and a record of expenses.
*This program was specially written for the month of April.*

Features:
•	Prints all the members of society
•	Generates a report on the Maintenance and the status (if it is paid/not paid & the balance left to be paid). Calculates the total Maintenance
•	Generates a report on Expenses and calculates the total.

Data Structures:
ArrayList for listing out the Member of society.
HashMap for Expenses.
LinkedHashMap for Maintenance and to print them in order.
