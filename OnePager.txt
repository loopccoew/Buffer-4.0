                                           A Solution by Team Code Slayers


This is a menstrual tracking application designed to help women track their menstrual cycle, predict the next period, and monitor symptoms related to the menstrual cycle. The main focus of this system is on the girls of age 12-19, the beginners who are really unaware of the process, the symptoms and the things that they are going through.


Features

- Easy tracking of menstrual cycles
- Machine Learning model for prediction of next period date
- Symptom tracking
- Option to add custom notes
- Support for multiple users
- Write about the system
- Anonymous note taking
- Chatbot for easy suggestions and conversations.


Technologies Used

- VS Code as the IDE
- Programming Language: Python 
- Different modules of Python like matplotlib, 
- Module re, to build a chatbot
- An algorithm of machine Learning for prediction of the date for the  next month
- web browser module for redirecting to the a website that the user chooses
- Data structure for static databases and other operations



Data Structures Used


Dictionary: The `responses` dictionary is used to store a collection of regular expressions as keys and their corresponding responses as values. In Python, a dictionary is a built-in data structure that allows you to store key-value pairs. In this case, the keys are regular expressions, and the values are the responses that the chatbot will give when the user's input matches one of these regular expressions. Dictionary of Dictionaries that are used in this system to store the products and the corresponding rating lists.
Dictionaries contribute mainly to our project making it the most used and most variabialy used data structure.

Regular expression: A regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of strings. In this case, the regular expressions in the `responses` dictionary are used to match the user's input to a particular response. Regular expressions can be created using the `re` module in Python, which provides functions for searching and manipulating strings using regular expressions.

Tuple: When iterating through the `responses` dictionary in the `chatbot` function, a tuple of two values (the pattern and response) is returned by the `items()` method. A tuple is an ordered collection of values, similar to a list. However, tuples are immutable, meaning that their values cannot be changed after they are created.

Lambda function: In the `re.sub` method used in the `chatbot` function, a lambda function is used to replace any captured groups in the response string with their corresponding values from the regular expression match. A lambda function is a small, anonymous function that can be defined inline with other code, typically for one-time use.

List: List of lists are used here to store the comments, suggestions and the views of customers regarding the system.Lists are important data structures that perform operations of a database here.


Scope of Improvement

- Content and Quality wise the system is really something that a teenager can rely on.
- This model can be deployed into an application that would have an interesting UI and can catch attention.
- This system right now has a static database and has a potential to work with databases and interact with it using a live website.
- Content wise we have provided an excellent system I believe
